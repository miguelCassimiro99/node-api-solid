# A Node.js API with SOLID+TDD

The main objective of this project was to learn about the concept of SOLID using TDD too.
The main features learned and applied to this API was:
- To develop an application when at the first moment you have to go under the problem without the concern of Database and Routes.
- Deal with entities on domain level.
- Use cases.
- Tests to make sure that it is working
- A base project structure to organize the flow.
- Repositories implementation (In tests too).
- InMemoryTestDatabse, by Martin Fowler
- Care about mock data and tests.

*This API was developed based on Rocketseat Decode #010 video posted on Youtube channel*

A special thanks to Rocketseat, Diego and all team for all the contents, lives and effort to teach people and for awakening the will to achive the Next Level.
